# Technocolab Machine Learning Engineer Internship Program - Data Visualization Course

This repository contains lessons and projects from the **Data Visualization** course, completed as part of Technocolab's Machine Learning Engineer Internship Program. The lessons utilize Python's popular visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visual representations of data.

## Course 2 - Data Visualization

1. **Hello, Seaborn**
   - Get introduced to Seaborn, a powerful Python library for creating beautiful data visualizations.

2. **Line Charts**
   - Learn to visualize trends over time with line charts, helping you understand patterns in time-series data.

3. **Bar Charts and Heatmaps**
   - Use bar charts to compare categories and heatmaps to represent data in a grid format using colors to convey magnitude.

4. **Scatter Plots**
   - Explore relationships between variables by plotting data points on the coordinate plane.

5. **Distributions**
   - Create histograms and density plots to understand the distribution of your data.

6. **Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles**
   - Learn how to choose the right plot for your data and apply custom styles to make your charts more visually appealing.

7. **Final Project**
   - A hands-on project where you apply all the techniques learned in previous lessons to a real-world dataset.

8. **Creating Your Own Notebooks**
   - Put your visualization skills into practice by creating your own notebooks, either for personal projects or professional work.
